@everyone, some updates for this server!

1. You can now save, edit and load your builds! Find out more at #server-info.

3. New custom emojis! May the :Frenzy::Mending: memery begin.

4. You can now add/remove your own roles from the list at #server-info. This will allow you to share and receive specific notifications when someone mentions your role.

5. Some updates to the price check tool. There's now a special formatter for mobile devices and longer searches (restricted to #bot-spam).

As always, keep bot-spam to #bot-spam and have fun with Guild Wars.
